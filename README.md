ios-launch-screen-template-for-sketch
=====================================

A pre-built [Sketch3](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) file for quickly exporting assets for iOS 8 [launch screen](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/MobileHIG/LaunchImages.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH22-SW1) (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad, iPad 2, iPad Mini)

Three magic steps:

1. Download the zipped Sketch3 file.
2. Open the file and add your artwork to each artboard.
3. Click the "Export" icon and choose the website that you want to spend all that free time on.

Got a better way? Awesome, I'm all ears. Pull a branch, and show me the magic.
